## API
A clean architecture approach has been followed to implement the API together with tests. Entities and repositories has been created for drinks and sales to later be implemented using JSON files adapters.
A migration command has been added to populate the "database" with tables and data.

# WebApp
Has been organized following the example on clean architecture in the Frontend given in [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md).
The application UX has been done using a vending machine as inspiration, the user adds money, types a code in the keyboard and the drink is bought if enough money is available.
